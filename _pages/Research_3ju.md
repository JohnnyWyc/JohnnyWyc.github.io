## Out-of-Distribution Detection via Self-Supervised Geometry Learning

Related: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13539)

* **Problem.** Existing OOD detection methods either rely on external outlier data or fail to provide explicit geometric separation between in-distribution and OOD samples.
* **Method.** Proposed a self-supervised OOD training framework guided by Neural Collapse, combining geometry-aware regularization with feature-space pseudo-OOD generation via class-wise mixup.
* **Contribution.** Enabled effective OOD detection without external outliers while explicitly shaping feature norm and angular geometry, achieving consistent improvements over strong post-hoc and outlier-free baselines.

## Distributionally Robust Invariant Learning for OOD Generalization

Related: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13539)

* **Problem.** Invariant learning methods address correlation shift but remain vulnerable to diversity shift and support mismatch under severe OOD settings.
* **Method.** Unified invariant risk minimization with sample-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by introducing a learnable adversarial reweighting mechanism.
* **Contribution.** Formulated a primal–dual–adversarial training objective that improves worst-case generalization across both classification and regression benchmarks.

## Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Invariant Risk Minimization

Related: [[ICLR 2025 Poster]](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/29073)

* **Problem.** Fixed regularization strength in IRM-based methods limits adaptability across heterogeneous environments.
* **Method.** Introduced an autonomous Total Variation penalty optimized via a minimax adversarial scheme.
* **Contribution.** Improved average and worst-case OOD generalization over IRM-TV baselines on multiple simulated and real-world datasets.

## Learning Attention Behaviors with Decision Trees

Related: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03879)

* **Problem.** Attention mechanisms in end-to-end speech recognition are difficult to interpret and analyze temporally.
* **Method.** Modeled attention dynamics using decision trees constructed from attention state transitions.
* **Contribution.** Revealed strong temporal dependence in attention evolution and demonstrated that attention states are highly predictable (>80% accuracy).

## Modular Cross-lingual Speech-to-Text Framework

* **Problem.** Cross-lingual speech recognition suffers from misaligned expression structures and phonetic inconsistencies.
* **Method.** Designed a modular attention-based alignment framework with a tone-aware phoneme representation.
* **Contribution.** Enabled early Mandarin-to-English speech-to-text benchmarking with improved efficiency and accuracy.
