## Bio

I am an M.Eng. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University (expected May 2025). My research interests include **out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and generalization**, **distributionally robust learning**, and **machine learning for decision-making and optimization**. I have worked with Prof. Bruno Abrahao (NYU) on self-supervised OOD detection and with Prof. Zhao-Rong Lai (Jinan University) on invariant learning and DRO-style robust training objectives.
