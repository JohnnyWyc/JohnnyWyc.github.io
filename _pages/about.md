## Bio

I am currently a Research Associate at New York University, working under the supervision of Prof. Bruno Abrahao. I received my Master’s degree from the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University in 2025.

My research interests focus on the interpretability and trust boundaries of deep learning models, with particular emphasis on model robustness, reliability, and safety under distributional shift. 

Recently, my work explores the security boundaries of deep learning models from two complementary perspectives: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and out-of-distribution generalization. I am interested in understanding how and why deep neural networks fail, and in developing principled methods that improve their reliability in high-stakes and open-world settings.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in machine learning, please feel free to contact me.
